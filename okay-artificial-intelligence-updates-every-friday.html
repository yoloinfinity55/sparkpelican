<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This content is based on a YouTube video exploring important concepts and insights.</p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
<p>Okay, artificial intelligence updates every Friday. Today, Friday, October 10th and uh the epigraph for today is there are no laws against outsourcing jobs to AI. That's why it happens so fast and as you see uh usually not many updates. So, LM arena leaderboard. So, what we see on this leaderboard first GLM 4.6 six. Uh it is here on the leaderboard but not as high as was predicted. Now there are two tables here. One is for chat and another is for coding. So for chat we have uh Gemini Claude and a lot of open AI yellow right and a lot of China open source models as you see on the bottom. Now for coding claude absolutely dominates. You see uh cloth set 4.5 and 4.1. Um that's what I'm using now. I'm using cloth set 4.5 and the pricing is the same as the previous uh set. So it's not very high. Uh you see Quen 3 is pretty high but this is quen 3 max which is not open source. Uh then we have claude again Gemini red 2.5 Pro. There are a lot of rumors about Gemini 3.0 zero maybe next week and then you see again a lot of uh China open source models open source is green. Okay. Uh next uh we had a event from Google Gemini and uh they basically made a new label called Gemini Enterprise which includes everything all their models all their tooling it's available globally for enterprise and it gives uh necessary security privacy uh and and and so on. their numbers, their growth uh is very very impressive. Uh so well generally that's what Google does. They used to have for example Google Adwords the small advertisement on the side of Google search but then they concentrated only on big businesses and it looks like this is their strategy to work with businesses right so uh they have models they have uh no code tools they have pre-built agents and tools to create new agents they integrate with uh Google workspace which is docs and Gmail and so on with Microsoft, SharePoint, Sub Oracle, Slack everything and you see governance and security and a lot of partners working with them. So yes, they're focusing on uh businesses as as they created workspace before uh so now they creating this Gemini enterprise for AI for businesses. uh OpenAI similar they had a dev day which is the annual conference where they introduced a lot of their tooling and again it's kind of you go to the chat and you have everything and you can do everything right and you can call external uh things like Spotify Zilo Canva whatever so you can edit or create documents uh you can record audio or video or generate something all in one place. Uh for example, Sora 2 now is available via API which is video generation. Uh you can edit code. Uh you can create um this agent</p>
