### Understanding the Diagnostics

These are warnings from the **webhint** tool (integrated via Microsoft Edge Tools in your IDE, likely VS Code), flagging the use of inline CSS styles in your HTML file (`_site/about/index.html`). The rule "no-inline-styles" promotes best practices for web performance and maintainability by discouraging embedded `<style>` tags or `style` attributes directly in HTML. Inline styles make code harder to reuse, cache, and manage across pages.

All four warnings point to `<style>` tags (based on the column spans, which typically cover the opening `<sty` or similar). Here's a breakdown:

| Warning # | Line | Columns | Likely Issue |
|-----------|------|---------|--------------|
| 1         | 42   | 4-7     | Opening `<style>` tag with inline CSS rules. |
| 2         | 67   | 6-9     | Another `<style>` tag (possibly nested or additional rules). |
| 3         | 76   | 6-9     | Similar to above—likely a continuation or separate block. |
| 4         | 101  | 4-7     | Closing or another opening `<style>` tag. |

These are **severity 4** (warnings, not errors), so your site will build and run fine, but addressing them improves code quality.

### Step-by-Step Fix

To resolve this, extract all inline CSS into an external file. Since this is in a `_site` directory (suggesting a static site generator like Jekyll), apply changes to your source files (e.g., in the root or `assets` folder) and regenerate the site.

1. **Open the file and locate the styles**:
   - Navigate to `/Users/minijohn/Documents/github-repo/spark/_site/about/index.html` in your editor.
   - Go to lines 42, 67, 76, and 101. You'll see `<style>` blocks like:
     ```html
     <style>
       /* Some CSS rules here */
     </style>
     ```
   - Copy **all** the CSS content from these blocks (e.g., rules for fonts, layouts, colors).

2. **Create an external CSS file**:
   - In your project's source directory (likely `spark/assets/css/` or similar), create a new file like `about.css` (or append to an existing `main.css` if it fits).
   - Paste the extracted CSS into it. Example:
     ```css
     /* about.css */
     body {
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif; /* Example rule—replace with your actual styles */
     }
     .hero-section {
       background-color: #f0f0f0;
     }
     /* Add all rules from the inline <style> tags here */
     ```

3. **Remove inline styles from HTML**:
   - Delete the entire `<style>...</style>` blocks from the HTML file (lines 42–101 span).
   - Your HTML should now look cleaner, without embedded CSS.

4. **Link the external CSS**:
   - In the `<head>` section of `index.html` (or your layout template if using Jekyll), add:
     ```html
     <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/about.css">
     ```
     - Adjust the `href` path based on your site structure (e.g., if it's in `_site/assets`, use relative paths like `../assets/css/about.css`).
     - If this is a Jekyll site, add the link to `_layouts/default.html` or similar for global reuse.

5. **Regenerate and test**:
   - Run your build command (e.g., `jekyll build` or `npm run build` for Spark-related projects).
   - Reload the page in a browser and inspect (F12) to confirm styles load from the external file.
   - Re-run your linter (e.g., via VS Code's Problems panel) to verify warnings are gone.

### Additional Tips
- **If styles are duplicated**: Check if these inline styles overlap with existing external CSS—consolidate to avoid bloat.
- **Performance bonus**: External CSS enables browser caching, reducing load times for users revisiting your site.
- **Suppress if needed**: If inline is intentional (e.g., for one-off testing), add `data-hint-ignore="no-inline-styles"` to the `<style>` tag, but this isn't recommended for production.
- **Project context**: If "spark" refers to a specific repo (e.g., Apache Spark docs or a custom site), search your codebase for a global CSS include to centralize this.

If you paste the relevant HTML snippet (lines 30–110) or more context, I can provide exact code diffs!
