A clean and well-organized project structure is crucial for any web project, and static sites built with Pelican are no exception. A streamlined setup not only makes development and maintenance easier but also improves collaboration. Based on a recent analysis of a Pelican project, here are five actionable suggestions to improve your workflow and project structure.

### 1. Consolidate Your Build and Automation Scripts

Many projects evolve to have multiple automation files, such as a `Makefile` and a `tasks.py` (using Invoke). While both can get the job done, having two separate files for similar tasks creates redundancy and can be confusing for new contributors.

**Suggestion:** Choose one automation tool and stick with it. For a Python-based project like Pelican, **Invoke (`tasks.py`)** is a more powerful and flexible choice. Migrate all your build, serve, and deployment tasks to `tasks.py` and remove the `Makefile`. This creates a single source of truth for all project automation.

### 2. Add a `requirements.txt` for Python Dependencies

Your project relies on Python packages like Pelican, Invoke, and `ghp-import`, but without a `requirements.txt` file, there's no explicit list of these dependencies. This makes it difficult for others (or your future self on a new machine) to set up the project environment correctly.

**Suggestion:** Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory. You can generate it by running:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This file should be committed to your repository, allowing anyone to install the correct dependencies with a single command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### 3. Integrate Your CSS Build with Pelican

In modern web development, it's common to use tools like Tailwind CSS, which require a build step. Often, this is handled by a separate npm script, forcing you to run two commands (`npm run build:css` and `pelican`) to build your site.

**Suggestion:** Integrate your CSS build process directly into the Pelican build. The `pelican-assets` plugin is an excellent tool for this. You can configure it to run your `npm run build:css` command automatically whenever you build your Pelican site, creating a seamless, one-command build process.

### 4. Organize Your Content into Subdirectories

As your website grows, a flat `content` directory with all your articles and pages in one place can become unwieldy. This makes it hard to find and manage your content.

**Suggestion:** Organize your content into subdirectories based on categories, topics, or content types. For example, you could structure your `content` directory like this:

```
content/
├── posts/
│   ├── my-first-post.md
│   └── another-great-post.md
├── pages/
│   └── about.md
└── projects/
    └── my-project.md
```

You can then configure Pelican in your `pelicanconf.py` to recognize and process this structure, leading to a much more organized and scalable project.

### 5. Refine Your Theme Structure

Your theme is the heart of your site's design, and its structure matters. Using a generic name like `mytheme` is a missed opportunity for branding and clarity.

**Suggestion:** Give your theme a more descriptive name, such as `sparkpelican-theme`. Additionally, consider the future of your theme by creating a `js` directory alongside your `css` directory for any JavaScript you might add later. You can also add a `theme.conf` file to your theme's root to specify theme-specific settings, making it more self-contained and reusable.

By implementing these five suggestions, you can create a more robust, maintainable, and efficient Pelican project that's a pleasure to work on.
