## Key Points

I set off for South Korea nearly 30 years The only newly developed developed country It's not the same as the rumors How do I change money when I go there for the first time? How to activate a transportation card What is the difference between visa-free and paid visa? Where can I find cheap and clean accommodation? How do Koreans speak English? This issue is a nanny-level guide Can be collected for later use Departing from Shenzhen Airport South Korea recently announced visa exemption for Chinese group tourists I just renewed my Korean individual visa for 5 years Is it a big loss? and no Group visa requires more than 3 people Follow the tour guide throughout the journey In and out together Basically just go to some popular check-in spots A more remote place The tour guide doesn't want to go you can't go There are many restrictions and i like to go Shopping in niche, off-the-beaten-path places So it has to be signed by an individual Let's check in now Asiana Airlines I chose this time South Korea's second largest airline But only one piece of 10kg luggage can be checked in Recommended before departure Weigh your suitcase October is the peak season I choose to leave after a long vacation One-way ticket to Seoul costs 1,200 yuan I don’t know how much the ticket you bought cost before boarding the plane Please confirm Completed electronic entry declaration for South Korea This is a necessary condition for taking the self-service channel If you want to keep electronic documents Please click this on your computer to print The files downloaded on the mobile phone are compressed and deformed. Arrive at the departure lounge There are two Korean ladies next to me I wanted to get some information But they said No English So we use a translator to communicate Please tell me the deadline for applying for night transportation cards 아 이거 다시 Ah sorry again 죄송한데 잘 몰라요 I don't know either Hahaha All right Let’s talk about it then boarding Korean flight attendants belong to high-income group Monthly salary is between 4 million and 5 million won Average age is about 25 years old The service attitude is also very good Two slips will be issued on the plane white and yellow We have electronic declaration for white No need to fill in Mainly fill in this yellow one is a statement about health Normally you have to choose None of the above symptoms The seat space is okay There is a punch left in the leg The plane took off normally Everyone, take a look at this seat mostly empty not many people Isn’t everyone going to go in October? Similar to Japan Airlines Asiana also provides Gamepad with full keyboard Can play some simple games And you can also have voice chat Tap the seat on the screen to call Enter the other party’s seat number Turn the handle over Just a telephone Sit
