This document provides a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for developing and managing the SparkPelican website. It is intended to guide developers through the common tasks and workflows involved in maintaining the site.

### 1. Project Setup

To set up the development environment, you will need to have Python, Node.js, and pip installed. Once these prerequisites are in place, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sparkpelican.git
    cd sparkpelican
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### 2. Content Creation

All content for the website is written in Markdown and stored in the `content/posts/` directory. To create a new blog post, follow these steps:

1.  **Create a new Markdown file:**
    Create a new `.md` file in the `content/posts/` directory. The filename should be descriptive and follow the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md`.

2.  **Add post metadata:**
    At the top of the new file, add the following metadata:
    ```markdown
    ---
    title: Your Post Title
    date: YYYY-MM-DD
    author: Your Name
    ---
    ```

3.  **Write your content:**
    Write the content of your blog post in Markdown format below the metadata.

### 3. Styling and Theming

The website's styling is managed by Tailwind CSS. To modify the styling, you will need to edit the Tailwind CSS input file and then rebuild the CSS.

1.  **Edit the input CSS file:**
    The main input file for Tailwind CSS is located at `themes/sparkpelican-theme/static/css/input.css`. You can modify this file to add or change CSS classes.

2.  **Build the output CSS file:**
    After editing the input file, you will need to run the following command to rebuild the `output.css` file:
    ```bash
    npm run build:css
    ```

### 4. Local Development

The project uses Invoke to automate common development tasks. The following commands are available:

*   **Build the site:**
    ```bash
    invoke build
    ```
    This command will build the Pelican site and generate the HTML files in the `output` directory.

*   **Serve the site locally:**
    ```bash
    invoke serve
    ```
    This command will start a local web server at `http://localhost:8000` to serve the generated site.

*   **Live reload:**
    ```bash
    invoke livereload
    ```
    This command will automatically rebuild the site and reload the browser whenever you make changes to the content or theme files.

### 5. Deployment

The website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever a new commit is pushed to the `main` branch. The deployment process is defined in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.

To deploy the site, simply push your changes to the `main` branch:
```bash
git push origin main
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will then automatically build and deploy the site to your GitHub Pages URL.
