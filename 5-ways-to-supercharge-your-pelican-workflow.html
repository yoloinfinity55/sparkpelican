        <p>A clean and well-organized project structure is crucial for any web project, and static sites built with Pelican are no exception. A streamlined setup not only makes development and maintenance easier but also improves collaboration. Based on a recent analysis of a Pelican project, here are five actionable suggestions to improve your workflow and project structure.</p>
<h3>1. Consolidate Your Build and Automation Scripts</h3>
<p>Many projects evolve to have multiple automation files, such as a <code>Makefile</code> and a <code>tasks.py</code> (using Invoke). While both can get the job done, having two separate files for similar tasks creates redundancy and can be confusing for new contributors.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Choose one automation tool and stick with it. For a Python-based project like Pelican, <strong>Invoke (<code>tasks.py</code>)</strong> is a more powerful and flexible choice. Migrate all your build, serve, and deployment tasks to <code>tasks.py</code> and remove the <code>Makefile</code>. This creates a single source of truth for all project automation.</p>
<h3>2. Add a <code>requirements.txt</code> for Python Dependencies</h3>
<p>Your project relies on Python packages like Pelican, Invoke, and <code>ghp-import</code>, but without a <code>requirements.txt</code> file, there's no explicit list of these dependencies. This makes it difficult for others (or your future self on a new machine) to set up the project environment correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Create a <code>requirements.txt</code> file in your project's root directory. You can generate it by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pip<span class="w"> </span>freeze<span class="w"> </span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>requirements.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>This file should be committed to your repository, allowing anyone to install the correct dependencies with a single command: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<h3>3. Integrate Your CSS Build with Pelican</h3>
<p>In modern web development, it's common to use tools like Tailwind CSS, which require a build step. Often, this is handled by a separate npm script, forcing you to run two commands (<code>npm run build:css</code> and <code>pelican</code>) to build your site.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Integrate your CSS build process directly into the Pelican build. The <code>pelican-assets</code> plugin is an excellent tool for this. You can configure it to run your <code>npm run build:css</code> command automatically whenever you build your Pelican site, creating a seamless, one-command build process.</p>
<h3>4. Organize Your Content into Subdirectories</h3>
<p>As your website grows, a flat <code>content</code> directory with all your articles and pages in one place can become unwieldy. This makes it hard to find and manage your content.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Organize your content into subdirectories based on categories, topics, or content types. For example, you could structure your <code>content</code> directory like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>content/
├── posts/
│   ├── my-first-post.md
│   └── another-great-post.md
├── pages/
│   └── about.md
└── projects/
    └── my-project.md
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can then configure Pelican in your <code>pelicanconf.py</code> to recognize and process this structure, leading to a much more organized and scalable project.</p>
<h3>5. Refine Your Theme Structure</h3>
<p>Your theme is the heart of your site's design, and its structure matters. Using a generic name like <code>mytheme</code> is a missed opportunity for branding and clarity.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Give your theme a more descriptive name, such as <code>sparkpelican-theme</code>. Additionally, consider the future of your theme by creating a <code>js</code> directory alongside your <code>css</code> directory for any JavaScript you might add later. You can also add a <code>theme.conf</code> file to your theme's root to specify theme-specific settings, making it more self-contained and reusable.</p>
<p>By implementing these five suggestions, you can create a more robust, maintainable, and efficient Pelican project that's a pleasure to work on.</p>
