We’ll come back later You can also walk here from Haneda Airport About 30–40 minutes on foot By train, five to six minutes Five minutes from the station to the lunch spot we wanted It’s already full Might need to wait We’re lining up at the door Staff said about 30 minutes The curry caught my husband’s eye Good thing—only 20 minutes and we got in A friendly shop run by an elderly couple First bowl of rice can be upsized for free Cabbage refills are free Katsu-don Pork is “Shureiton,” a brand from Ibaraki All the sauces are homemade Left: French sea salt Right: German rock salt It’s filled to the brim—careful Cabbage refills available—just ask Thank you I got the curry with fillet katsu I upsized my rice So it looks like a huge plate The cabbage for my katsu curry comes on the side I ordered fillet katsu This is the regular size You can go large too One extra katsu à la carte (400 yen, tax in) Chuno sauce plus demi-glace And ketchup on top Three sauces mixed Their own house blend Pork is Shureiton raised in Tsukuba, Ibaraki The note says the curry is spicy Nine kinds of spices This pork is really tasty Tender, with a nice pork aroma You can really taste the spices in the curry It does have a little heat The cutlet is also Shureiton The cutlet’s pretty good too Pork miso soup with the set So many ingredients Even chunks of meat in the soup Crisp, not greasy coating, tender meat—both of us loved it So full.
