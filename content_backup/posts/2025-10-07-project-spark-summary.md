Welcome to a behind-the-scenes look at the Spark blog project. This post serves as a summary of the architecture, technologies, and features that power this site. Whether you're a developer looking for inspiration or just curious about how it works, here's a breakdown of what makes Spark tick.

### The Technology Stack

At its core, Spark is a modern static site built with a focus on performance, developer experience, and clean aesthetics. The key technologies used are:

*   **Eleventy (11ty):** A flexible and powerful static site generator that transforms our Markdown content and Nunjucks templates into a fast, pre-rendered website.
*   **Tailwind CSS v4:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development and a highly customizable design system without writing custom CSS.
*   **Nunjucks:** A rich and powerful templating language for JavaScript, used by Eleventy to create reusable layouts and components (`base.njk`, `post.njk`, etc.).
*   **PostCSS:** A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins. Here, it's used to process Tailwind CSS and minify the final stylesheet for production.
*   **Google Generative AI:** The project includes a script (`generate-descriptions.js`) that leverages the Google Generative AI SDK, demonstrating a modern workflow for automating content creation tasks like writing post descriptions.

### Core Features

This project isn't just a simple blog; it comes with several features built-in:

*   **Modern & Animated UI:** The frontend is designed with a clean, "glassmorphism" aesthetic, featuring subtle animations and gradients to create a polished user experience.
*   **Dynamic Blog Content:** All posts are managed as simple Markdown files in the `src/posts` directory, making content creation straightforward. The site automatically generates post pages, lists, and an RSS feed.
*   **Data-Driven Templates:** The templates are designed to be dynamic, pulling information like author and reading time directly from each post's front matter.
*   **Search-Ready:** The project includes `flexsearch`, a fast client-side search library, and generates a search index. The UI for the search functionality is the next step to be implemented.
*   **Embed-Friendly:** Using the `eleventy-plugin-embed-everything` plugin, embedding content like YouTube videos is seamless.

### Development Workflow

The project is set up with a simple and efficient development workflow managed by npm scripts:

*   `npm run dev`: Starts a local development server with hot-reloading for both Eleventy and Tailwind CSS, allowing for real-time previews of any changes.
*   `npm run build`: Creates a production-ready build of the site in the `_site` directory, with minified CSS.
*   `npm run generate:descriptions`: An example of a custom script to automate content tasks using AI.

### What's Next?

While the foundation is solid, there are several exciting improvements planned:

1.  **Full Search Implementation:** Building the UI to connect with the already-generated search index.
2.  **Social Sharing:** Adding buttons to make it easy for readers to share posts on social media.
3.  **Tag Pages:** Creating dedicated pages for each tag to allow for better content discovery.
4.  **Performance Optimization:** Implementing automated image optimization and purging unused CSS to make the site even faster.

This project serves as a strong starting point for anyone looking to build a modern, feature-rich static blog. Thanks for reading!
