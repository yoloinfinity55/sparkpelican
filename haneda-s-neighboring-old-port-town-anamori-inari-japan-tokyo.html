        <p>Almost at Anamori Inari Hi, I’m Satori I’m at Anamori-Inari Station It’s close to Haneda Airport Keikyu Airport Line, two stops, about five minutes Right outside the station, I saw the cute mascot, Kon-chan Someone offered deep-fried tofu skins We’re eating near the station today I found a place, should be around here We’ll head straight down this road There’s a big torii gate around here Then if you keep going, you’ll reach Anamori Inari Shrine We saw a torii as soon as we left the station There’s also a pudding shop right outside Looks good. We’ll come back later You can also walk here from Haneda Airport About 30–40 minutes on foot By train, five to six minutes Five minutes from the station to the lunch spot we wanted It’s already full Might need to wait We’re lining up at the door Staff said about 30 minutes The curry caught my husband’s eye Good thing—only 20 minutes and we got in A friendly shop run by an elderly couple First bowl of rice can be upsized for free Cabbage refills are free Katsu-don Pork is “Shureiton,” a brand from Ibaraki All the sauces are homemade Left: French sea salt Right: German rock salt It’s filled to the brim—careful Cabbage refills available—just ask Thank you I got the curry with fillet katsu I upsized my rice So it looks like a huge plate The cabbage for my katsu curry comes on the side I ordered fillet katsu This is the regular size You can go large too One extra katsu à la carte (400 yen, tax in) Chuno sauce plus demi-glace And ketchup on top Three sauces mixed Their own house blend Pork is Shureiton raised in Tsukuba, Ibaraki The note says the curry is spicy Nine kinds of spices This pork is really tasty Tender, with a nice pork aroma You can really taste the spices in the curry It does have a little heat The cutlet is also Shureiton The cutlet’s pretty good too Pork miso soup with the set So many ingredients Even chunks of meat in the soup Crisp, not greasy coating, tender meat—both of us loved it So full.</p>

<h2>Key Points</h2>
<p>Almost at Anamori Inari Hi, I’m Satori I’m at Anamori-Inari Station It’s close to Haneda Airport Keikyu Airport Line, two stops, about five minutes Right outside the station, I saw the cute mascot, Kon-chan Someone offered deep-fried tofu skins We’re eating near the station today I found a place, should be around here We’ll head straight down this road There’s a big torii gate around here Then if you keep going, you’ll reach Anamori Inari Shrine We saw a torii as soon as we left the station There’s also a pudding shop right outside Looks good.

That was a good spot Great value for money We’ll walk straight down Bentenbashi-dori Ten minutes to the Peace Otorii Is this a teppan place where you can work out? Kinda wild. Not sure I get it We always ride straight to the last stop, Haneda Airport Never gotten off on the way Today’s our first time getting off mid-route Every time we passed these stations I’d wonder what’s around here There’s the big torii It really stands out by the river So striking on the riverbank The bridge shows scenes of old seaweed harvesting Lots of people fishing on the bank This torii was dedicated by Keikyu in 1929 to the old Anamori Inari Shrine It’s not related to the current shrine “Peace” is written on the torii After the war, the U.S. forces expanded</p>
